## **12\. Types of Action Modes**

You can enter any input you like, and the spinner wheel will make the final decision. Users can select from three options to make the best decision.

### **12.1. Normal Mode**

This mode is a one-time random decision picker. When the user hits the "done" button, the randomizer wheel will reveal the outcome they have chosen. The chosen outcome won't have any negative effects, like being hidden.

#### **Use Case 1**

In a situation where it functions similarly to a digital prize wheel, this could be utilized as a random name Picker Wheel. After the wheel is spun, one winner will be selected from the list of contestants. For more involved exercises, you can also utilize the wheel in conjunction with a countdown timer.

### **12.2. Elimination Mode**

By removing each input one at a time, it alternatively chooses a random name. In the following round, the outcome will be momentarily taken off the wheel.

#### **Use Case 2**

The teacher can utilize this wheel of names in the classroom to call on each student to answer a question individually without using the same name twice.

### **12.3. Accumulation Mode**

It is a technique of accumulation of random decisions. Each chosen input's count is added up and carried over to the following spin.

#### **Use Case 3**

You can use this to choose what to eat. Instead of just spinning the wheel once to choose what to eat (a one-time outcome may make the user less convinced), this mode counts the number of options after multiple spins to persuade you to choose.
