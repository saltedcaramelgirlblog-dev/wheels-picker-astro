## About Wheels Picker

We created wheels picker in Aug 2025 as side project for our main project ( Food Blog ), it was just a fun way to express our knowledge to make great web apps that are simple yet fun to play! Whether you’re picking a random winner, choosing what to eat, or just looking for a playful way to make a quick decision, Wheelspicker has you covered.

It’s designed to be straightforward: add your choices, spin the wheel, and let chance decide. No overthinking, no stress, just a fair and easy way to get an answer.

I built Wheelspicker to make everyday choices a little lighter and more fun.

If you have any type of new ideas and games you candefinetly send us a note in the contact page, and we will do our best to serve the best version of it, and ultimatly develop it and make it available here in the site.
